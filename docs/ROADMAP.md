# Roadmap

AIPermission is preparing its first public release candidate. The project is
feature-complete for the local-only MVP; the remaining work is release
packaging, final dogfooding, and small post-RC hardening.

## Current Status

`0.1.0-rc.1` is code-complete for the first local developer workflow:

- Docker Compose local runtime at `http://localhost:3210`.
- SQLCipher encrypted named `.aipdb` databases.
- Local UI session and CSRF protection for web REST mutations.
- Gateway-owned SSH keys, SSH host fingerprint approval, and `known_hosts`
  pinning.
- Server inventory, server hints, SSH key install commands, and uninstall
  cleanup.
- MCP tokens with `always_run`, `approval_required`, and `blocked` execution
  rules.
- Token expiration, reusable-token opt-in, and global MCP Started/Stopped
  switch.
- Persistent console sessions with live attach, AI command display, messages,
  transcript chunks, and history.
- Approval dialogs, user notes, AI-to-user messages, audit logs, and searchable
  History/Audit pages.
- Redaction settings with built-in and custom regex rules.
- MCP npm package, setup CLI, operator skill installer, and public package
  metadata.
- README screenshots, ADRs, security policy, contributing guide, release
  checklist, CodeQL, Dependabot, tests, audits, and secret scan.

## Project Boundaries

AIPermission is intentionally:

- Local-only.
- Single-user.
- Developer-focused.
- SSH-based.
- Human-in-the-loop.

These requests conflict with the project principles and should normally be
closed as `wontfix`:

- Hosted SaaS mode.
- Multi-tenant architecture.
- Remote gateway hosting.
- Shared team deployments.
- LAN-accessible gateway mode.
- Cloud-managed command execution.

## Before Public RC

- [ ] Create the clean public repository state on `main`.
- [ ] Publish the organization profile repository `aipermission/.github`.
- [ ] Apply the initial GitHub label set.
- [ ] Run the release checklist from a clean clone.
- [ ] Verify README screenshots render on GitHub.
- [ ] Publish `@aipermission/mcp@0.1.0` with public npm access.
- [ ] Publish the unscoped `aipermission` placeholder package after the npm
  unpublish cooldown, using a new version such as `0.0.3`.
- [ ] Create the `v0.1.0-rc.1` GitHub release.
- [ ] Run one final real SSH/MCP dogfooding pass.

## Early Post-RC

These are good candidates for small follow-up releases after the first public
tag:

- [ ] Add permission expiration for temporary server access grants.
- [ ] Add temporary `always_run` grants with visible countdowns in Console.
- [ ] Add command policy/risk scoring primitives without turning the product
  into a DevOps platform.
- [ ] Add optional deny/warn rules for common high-risk command patterns.
- [ ] Add structured manual command event parsing for History.
- [ ] Add optional safety backup before import.
- [ ] Add more Playwright browser tests for Settings, import, token permission,
  and approval workflows.
- [ ] Expand frontend component tests.
- [ ] Add more MCP client setup examples as the client ecosystem changes.
- [ ] Add a documented release cadence for small RC follow-up updates.
- [ ] Open and maintain a visible good-first-issue pool.

## Later Ideas

These may be useful, but they are not required for the RC:

- [ ] SQL query tools with explicit database credential boundaries.
- [ ] Optional sensitive/no-persist console sessions.
- [ ] Export filters for History and Audit data.
- [ ] FTS5 search only if the SQLCipher driver/build supports it without
  increasing install friction. The current release uses SQLCipher-compatible
  FTS4 search.
- [ ] Chunk retention and compaction controls for very long console sessions.

## Maintenance Rules

- After the first public tag, do not edit migration `1`; add migration `2+` for
  schema changes.
- Keep docs, UI copy, comments, and package metadata in English.
- Keep README, SECURITY, ADRs, MCP docs, and REST docs aligned with the code.
- Keep local-only warnings visible in public docs and release notes.
- Keep `approval_required` as the recommended default for normal AI-assisted
  work.
- Keep screenshots current when the main UI changes.
