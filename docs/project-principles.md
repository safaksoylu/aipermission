# Project Principles

AIPermission has a deliberately narrow product shape. These principles are
part of the security model, not marketing copy.

## AIPermission Is Intentionally

- Local-only
- Single-user
- Developer-focused
- SSH-based
- Human-in-the-loop

## AIPermission Intentionally Rejects

- Hosted SaaS deployments
- Multi-user RBAC systems
- Team collaboration features
- Cloud-managed execution
- LAN-accessible deployments

## Why This Boundary Exists

AIPermission gives AI agents controlled command access to real servers. That is
powerful, so the product keeps the trust boundary small:

- the gateway runs on the developer's own machine,
- the browser UI talks to localhost,
- MCP clients authenticate with local API tokens,
- SSH keys stay inside the encrypted local gateway,
- humans can require approval before commands run.

Turning the gateway into a shared service would require a different product:
remote authentication, account recovery, CSRF assumptions, tenant isolation,
RBAC, team audit policy, network hardening, and incident response workflows.
Those are intentionally outside this project's scope.

## Will Not Implement

The following requests conflict with the project principles and should normally
be closed as `wontfix`:

- Hosted SaaS mode
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Remote gateway hosting
- Shared team deployments
- LAN-accessible gateway mode
- Cloud-managed command execution

Suggested closure note:

Closed as wontfix.
Conflicts with AIPermission project principles:
local-only, single-user, developer-focused, human-in-the-loop.
```

## Acceptable Extensions

These areas can evolve without changing the core identity:

- better MCP client setup,
- safer approval UX,
- clearer audit/history browsing,
- stronger local hardening,
- more tests,
- documentation and troubleshooting,
- local command policy warnings,
- temporary token or permission expiration.

When in doubt, ask whether the proposal keeps AIPermission a local permission
gateway for one developer. If it turns the project into a hosted operations
platform, it belongs outside the core project.
