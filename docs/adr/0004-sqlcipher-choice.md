# ADR 0004: SQLCipher For Local Databases

Status: accepted

## Context

AIPermission stores server records, token metadata, audit data, command history,
message queues, and vaulted SSH private keys. The database may be backed up and
moved between machines.

## Decision

AIPermission uses SQLCipher for full local database encryption. Secret payloads
inside the database are also handled through the gateway vault layer.

## Consequences

- Database passwords are unrecoverable.
- `.aipdb` files are portable encrypted workspace backups.
- The vault layer is not a second independent security boundary if the database
  password is also compromised.
- REST and MCP responses must never return SSH private keys or database secrets.
